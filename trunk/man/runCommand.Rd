\title{Issue the System Call That Invokes NONMEM}
\description{
	If \code{udef} is \code{FALSE}, \code{command} is passed to \code{nm.pl} with supporting arguments.  If \code{grid}
	is \code{TRUE}, the result is passed to \code{qsub} with supporting arguments.  If \code{background}
	is \code{TRUE}, \sQuote{&} is appended to the result.  Each element of the result is executed
  in succession using a system call customized by platform.

\details{
	The argument \sQuote{L} represents a possibly-constituative instance of \code{qsub}'s \sQuote{l},
but is not called \sQuote{l} so that other instances of \sQuote{l} (multiple are allowed)
will not accidentally override it.  Users can override intentionally, of course.

\code{N}, \code{L}, and \code{hold_jid} are coordinated so that if a run is split, compile status is flagged
on the compile run, and the execute run waits for compile to finish.

\sQuote{q} is handled specially.  When overriding, be sure to pass a character vector of
length one for a normal run, and of length two if \code{split} is \code{TRUE} (the default when
\code{grid} is \code{TRUE}).  By default, all standalone compile-only runs are diverted to 
\sQuote{compile.q}, as well as all compile halves of split runs.  By default, all execute-only
runs as well as the execute halves of split runs are diverted to \sQuote{all.q}.
