\details{
	Given a run name and project directory, \code{superset} figures out the 
	run directory and location of a NONMEM control stream. It reads the control
	stream to identify the run-time location of input and output files, 
	as well as the "ignore" (and/or "accept") criteria that relate extent
	of input records to extent of output records.  \code{read.input} and
	\code{read.output} are lists consisting of functions and arguments
	appropriate for reading input and output file formats, respectively.
	The ignore criteria will be reconstructed per row so that output can be
	mapped unambiguously to input.  Alternatively, if \code{key} is provided,
	it is used as an object model to allow an inferential left join of output
	onto intput; this approach is riskier, but can back fill NA cells with 
	values that are otherwise constant within left-subsets of the key.
	
	For the usual invocation (zero-length key) \code{superset} tries to load
	columns from output tables onto the input table. Naming convention of
	the input is retained, and output column names are mapped by position, 
	using the control stream input criteria. Output tables are restored to 
	input dimensions using the "ignore" criteria, then checked for length: 
	currently, \code{superset} ignores output tables having fewer rows than 
	the input, as well as output tables whose row count is not a multiple 
	of input row count.
	
	Output tables may contain versions of input columns.  Disposition depends
	on the value of \code{exclusive}. If a character vector, it lists columns 
	to exclude from output. If \code{TRUE}, all columns with re-used names 
	will be dropped. If \code{FALSE}, such columns will be renamed 
	(*.n, where n is table number). If \code{NULL}, only informative 
	columns will be retained and renamed.  A column is informative if any 
	element is informative.  An element is informative if it is newly generated
	(not NA and not zero, but original is NA) or if it is an alteration (non-NA,
	and different from non-NA original). If the column pair can be interpreted
	as numeric, "different" is determined using only the first \code{digits} digits.
	
	Only the first instance of any column among successive output tables is retained.
	
	\code{ignored} takes a subset of \code{superset} arguments and returns just
	a logical vector showing which input rows are dropped. Note that it is 
	possible to invoke either function using just \code{run}, just \code{rundir},
	or just \code{ctlfile}, supplying \code{project} as necessary.  Normally these 
	three are tightly coordinated and may be inferred from each other.

	\itemize{
	\item \code{superset}: data.frame where row count is a multiple of (usually equal to) input row count 
	\item \code{ignored} a logical vector indicating which rows were dropped.
