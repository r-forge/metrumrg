5.47

* Documentation has been altered to comply with new CRAN line length restrictions.

5.44

* example(xpath2frame) is now not run, with explanation.

5.43

* The examples for xpath2frame trap the case where libxml version is 2.8; problems there are suspected.

5.42

* This version attempts to fix a CRAN test error that occurs for an xpath2frame example: Casting formula contains variables not found in molten data: obj, node.

5.41

5.36

* Bugfix in 'cast' method for class 'keyed': there is now an explicit search for 'as' function if and when restoring class of 'value'. see ?`cast,keyed-method`.

* This ChangeLog is introduced.

5.35

* lyse.data.frame now returns keyed data frames.

* superset strips blank lines from $INPUT when parsing control streams.

5.33

The special value NA for the argument 'as' was not respected after data.frame changed the way matrix names are handled.  A workaround is implemented.  Several minor edits were made to help files.

5.32

* A bug in runCommand prevented 'interface' from being specified as a function rather than function name.

* A bug in rlog prevented dots from being passed to as.unilog.run, e.g. to control extfile.

5.31

5.30

* Recent changes to xpath were causing a problem in rlog that was mistakenly attributed to .minstat.  Reverting to prior versions pending resolution.

5.29

* rlog calls .minstat, which now returns NA instead of NULL if termination_status is not in *.xml.  

* General improvements to sortedInstall, courtesy of N. Hsiang.

rlog and related functions have been redrafted ...

* default tool for partab, rlog, and as.unilog.run is now 'nm7' instead of 'nm6'

* cleanup does not remove INTER (needed by runstate).

* runstate supports testfile "indifference".

* runlog tries to give a more meaningful minimization status than just 1/0.

* superset now can grow the input data to match the dimensions of nrow-multiple output table.

5.17

* metrumrg 5.17 introduces classes "init" and "initList" (@rev 114).  The $THETA record of a NONMEM control stream can be represented as a numbered list of "init" objects, rather than just a character vector.  "init" and "initList" support programmatic manipulation of model initializations.  See examples for "init".

5.16

* NONR calls fork::fork to distinguish from multicore::fork.

* In helpBrowse, relationships between online and local vignettes are explicit.

* AUC now gives warnings if critical columns contain NA; help page updated.

* PLOTR now accepts include.all=TRUE, which gives an additional set of global diagnostics when groups have been specified.  

* findNonmemCommand helps locate NONMEM executables.

* NONR now makes a verbose attempt to supply "command" using this function. 

* Bugfix for the epliog argument of NONR.  

* Bugfix ("3G") for text2decimal.

5.14

* metrumrg 5.14 fixes a bug in superset:  NAs now have more predictable interpretation.  

* Better help for LDOS in as.nm.

* Better dots handling in as.digest.data.frame.

5.13

* The development version of R issues warnings when checking 5.12:  several arguments are identified by partial matching of argument names.  Fixed here.

5.12

* metrumrg 5.12 fixes bugs in noPk.nm, as.digest.data.frame, [.conditioned, format.legacy, and index.isolated.

5.11

* metrumrg 5.11 fixes a bug in as.digest.keyed.

5.10

* metrumrg 5.10 has new functions:  superset, digest, lyse, dynamic, sortedInstall (welcome author Natalie Hsiang), as.best.comment, as.best.temporal, as.data.frame.keyed.  

* metaMerge no longer has a groom argument, and binding proceeds from left to right (first frame is merged with merge of remaining, recursively).  

* as.best.data.frame has more-informative error messages.

*as.best.default tries to do something intelligent for mixed character-numeric.

5.9

* raised.keyed has been redefined as a serial left join.

5.8

* The function addl is now generic, with a default method and a method for data.frame.  

* A bug is fixed in rlog, which now allows passing of "dots" arguments to called functions.  

* raised.keyed is introduced as a proxy for ^.keyed: experimental and subject to change.

5.7

* In metrumrg 5.7, as.pdf.tex becomes tex2pdf, since it is really not a method for as.pdf.  

* unique.comment is added so that comments are not unclassed when tested for unique values.  

* A sasdate method has been added for as.mDate.  

* as.best is a new grooming generic with methods for vectors and data.frames.  

* metaMerge is a multi-way merge generic with methods for data.frames and character vectors.  

* addl is a new function that aids compaction of nonmem records using ADDL and II.  

* xyplot.ext is now xyplotExt so that it does not look like an attempt to give a method for xyplot.

5.6

* viewtex calls as.pdf.tex to wrap the contents of a tex file appropriately and display it in the default pdf viewer.  By default, viewtex deletes intermediate files after 1 second (presumably enough time to get them open).  You can also pass onefile=TRUE, which is an argument to as.pdf.tex.

5.5

* data/ctl has moved.  

* metrumrgURL has been implemented for offline access to internal help files.

5.4

* metrumrg 5.4 has a new entry on the main help page.  The 'browse' link takes you to a list of annotated scripts that demonstrate various pharmacometric tasks using metrumrg tools.  Some involve NONMEM; for full reproducibility, check out the repository onto a machine with an NMQual-mediated NONMEM 7.2 installation.

5.3

* metrumrg 5.3 fixes a bug in resample.data.frame().  If the user supplied the extra argument 'na', it was partially-matched to the 'name' argument of a function defined internally, preventing intended use.

* The pattern argument for rlog has been augmented.

5.2

* as.pdf and related functions support creating pdf's directly from data frames.  The utility 'pdflatex' must already be present at the OS level, and visible on the command line.

5.1

* metrumrg 5.1 is essentially a clone of MIfuns 5.1. Package name has changed to more accurately reflect sponsorship.  See mifuns.googlecode.com for prior versions.
