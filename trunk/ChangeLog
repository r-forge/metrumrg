5.41

* A bug is fixed in the keyed method for cast: it prevented type coercion for 'value' columns with where length of class was greater than one.

5.40

* All metrumrgURL examples in help files are now configured not to run automatically.

* NONR now calls fork::handleSIGCLD and fork::exit explicitly.

* Additional error trapping is added for xpath2frame.

5.39

* Support is added for finding the difference of two timepoints.

5.38

* xlog and xpath2frame are introduced experimentally to deal with multiple xpath expressions.

5.37

* NONR72 now writes command to cat file.

* runNonmem now accepts pe argument (default NA). Only if pe is defined, and attempt is made to copy the parallelization file.  If the file is not found, a message is written to run.cat. template.pnm is now sought in the parent of 'command' if not found in the streams directory.

5.36

* Bugfix in 'cast' method for class 'keyed': there is now an explicit search for 'as' function if and when restoring class of 'value'. see ?`cast,keyed-method`.

* This ChangeLog is introduced.

5.35

* Implementation of reapply is modernized, greatly simplifying the code and increasing speed about 6-fold. 'where' is now a true subset argument, rather than a mere NA generator.

5.34

* as.digest.data.frame has been completely rewritten.

* as.digest.nm now passes dots arguments.

* summary method for keyed now gives number of unsorted rows.

* uniKey now uses \r internally as an element separator to reduce conflation of keys.

* classes nominal and temporal are renamed to duration and timepoint; both are subclasses of timeline.

* better support for adding and subtracting timeline objects.

* crosses gains an 'all' argument.

* aug follows transform's conventions: _data is first argument and expressions are evaluated in parent frame.

* lyse.data.frame now returns keyed data frames.

* superset strips blank lines from $INPUT when parsing control streams.

5.33

The special value NA for the argument 'as' was not respected after data.frame changed the way matrix names are handled.  A workaround is implemented.  Several minor edits were made to help files.

5.32

* A bug in runCommand prevented 'interface' from being specified as a function rather than function name.

* A bug in rlog prevented dots from being passed to as.unilog.run, e.g. to control extfile.

5.31

* as.digest.data.frame supplies a key for any dynamic residual table.

* as.keyed now has a default key: character(0).

* For keyed objects, methods are defined for melt (S3) and cast (S4).

5.30

* Recent changes to xpath were causing a problem in rlog that was mistakenly attributed to .minstat.  Reverting to prior versions pending resolution.

5.29

* rlog calls .minstat, which now returns NA instead of NULL if termination_status is not in *.xml.  

* General improvements to sortedInstall, courtesy of N. Hsiang.

5.28

* Better support for character model names in NONR.

* as.vector.keyed method returns the names of a keyed data frame.

* Binary operators are defined for set relations, e.g. %u% for union.

* ncomma reports names of an object, delimited with commas.

* pe is formal argument to NONR72.

* Operators  *, /, and ! are defined for keyed data frames.

* shuffle accepts logical and numeric values for 'who', and character, integer, NA, or NULL for 'after'.

* Succinct messaging is implemented for Ops.keyed: displays only the first 5 to 7 matching column names.

* Improvements to xpath courtesy of Klaas Prins: now works for matrices.

* Better algorithm for finding par files in control streams.

* suppressed warnings in isSubversionedFile.

5.27

* template.pmn is now template.pnm.

5.26

* metrumrg 5.26 adds a citation, also listed on the homepage for this site.  

* It improves INPUT handling for control streams (ignoring leading whitespace). 

* It traps some esoteric errors in superset.  

* WRES is added to the canonical list of residuals, plottable by PLOTR, etc.  

* PLOTR(logtrans=TRUE) now recognizes the full list of DV and PRED variants.  

* /opt/nonmem is now a search path for findNonmemCommand, in addition to /opt/NONMEM.

5.25

* metrumrg 5.25 makes minor edits to various help files. 

* superset now strips comments before parsing input record from NONMEM control stream.

5.24

* metrumrg 5.24 fixes a bug in superset:  white space surrounding commas in an ignore statement of a control stream is now stripped.  

* New functions bundleRead and nasum are included, courtesy of Natalie Hsiang.  

* sortedInstall has been updated.

5.23

metrumrg 5.23 fixes the help example for xpath, which did not work with metrumrg as packaged.

5.22

* The head method for class digest is defined.

* as.nm.R has an exception message altered for the new definition of 'crosses.

* [[.nmctl is redefined to give the expected result.

completely reworked for consistency.

* is.defined ... well ... is defined.

* pool is defined.

* convertLines is defined.

* cwresPlots now supports all variants of RES in NONMEM 7.2.0. Variants of 
PRED already supported in 5.21.

5.21

* Bugs are fixed in padded, as.day.week, and [.keyed.

* Support is introduced for plotting arbitrary variants of residuals tabled by NONMEM.

5.20

* PLOTR now returns the plotting data set invisibly.  Formerly, it did not have an explicit return value.

5.19

* metrumrg 5.19 supports interconversion among nominal time units: second, minute, hour, day, week, month, year.  See help for "as.second".

5.18

NONR has been significantly redrafted ...

* concurrent now defaults to grid & !boot.

* Experimental 'delay' has been dropped.

* NONR now has an invisible return value.

* runCommand and runNonmem have return values.

* NONR help has example invocations.

* cleanup does not remove INTER (needed by runstate).

* most errors are now silent return values.

* most warnings are now dumped to run.cat.

* new functions progress, follow, and qstat help resolve run state.


rlog and related functions have been redrafted ...

* default tool for partab, rlog, and as.unilog.run is now 'nm7' instead of 'nm6'

* cleanup does not remove INTER (needed by runstate).

* runstate supports testfile "indifference".

* runlog tries to give a more meaningful minimization status than just 1/0.

* rlog returns min: -1 for missing runs, rather than issuing a warning.

* rlog returns min:error for "running" runs (rather than ignoring).


Additionally ...

* as.nmctl no longer gives 80 column warning.

* new function 'tweak' adjusts initial estimates in a control stream.

* new function 'padded' pads numbers on the left with zeros, to specified width.

* superset now can grow the input data to match the dimensions of nrow-multiple output table.

5.17

* metrumrg 5.17 introduces classes "init" and "initList" (@rev 114).  The $THETA record of a NONMEM control stream can be represented as a numbered list of "init" objects, rather than just a character vector.  "init" and "initList" support programmatic manipulation of model initializations.  See examples for "init".

5.16

* NONR calls fork::fork to distinguish from multicore::fork.

* In helpBrowse, relationships between online and local vignettes are explicit.

* AUC now gives warnings if critical columns contain NA; help page updated.

* Experimental support in rlog() for SAEM method.

* Bugfix: partab now supports tables with only one row.

* NONR has a delay argument that introduces time between run invocations (experimental).

* PLOTR has an experimental option to use superset instead of dataSynthesis.

* superset includes a run-specific ignore flag.

* superset allows four options for excluding redundant columns.

* new function ignored returns a logical vector indicating which rows NONMEM ignored.

5.15

* iterations uses better subsetting.  

* seq.temporal allows more varied invocations.  

* PLOTR is more cautiously conditional in what it attempts to plot.  

* PLOTR now accepts include.all=TRUE, which gives an additional set of global diagnostics when groups have been specified.  

* findNonmemCommand helps locate NONMEM executables.

* NONR now makes a verbose attempt to supply "command" using this function. 

* Bugfix for the epliog argument of NONR.  

* Bugfix ("3G") for text2decimal.

5.14

* metrumrg 5.14 fixes a bug in superset:  NAs now have more predictable interpretation.  

* Better help for LDOS in as.nm.

* Better dots handling in as.digest.data.frame.

5.13

* The development version of R issues warnings when checking 5.12:  several arguments are identified by partial matching of argument names.  Fixed here.

5.12

* metrumrg 5.12 fixes bugs in noPk.nm, as.digest.data.frame, [.conditioned, format.legacy, and index.isolated.

5.11

* metrumrg 5.11 fixes a bug in as.digest.keyed.

5.10

* metrumrg 5.10 has new functions:  superset, digest, lyse, dynamic, sortedInstall (welcome author Natalie Hsiang), as.best.comment, as.best.temporal, as.data.frame.keyed.  

* metaMerge no longer has a groom argument, and binding proceeds from left to right (first frame is merged with merge of remaining, recursively).  

* as.best.data.frame has more-informative error messages.

*as.best.default tries to do something intelligent for mixed character-numeric.

5.9

* raised.keyed has been redefined as a serial left join.

* Generic static with data.frame method has been introduced.

* getdname is now generic.

* text2decimal now supports scientific notation, with extended example.

* functions.R includes undocumented experimental utilities for supersetting datasets.

5.8

* The function addl is now generic, with a default method and a method for data.frame.  

* A bug is fixed in rlog, which now allows passing of "dots" arguments to called functions.  

* raised.keyed is introduced as a proxy for ^.keyed: experimental and subject to change.

5.7

* In metrumrg 5.7, as.pdf.tex becomes tex2pdf, since it is really not a method for as.pdf.  

* unique.comment is added so that comments are not unclassed when tested for unique values.  

* A sasdate method has been added for as.mDate.  

* as.best is a new grooming generic with methods for vectors and data.frames.  

* metaMerge is a multi-way merge generic with methods for data.frames and character vectors.  

* addl is a new function that aids compaction of nonmem records using ADDL and II.  

* xyplot.ext is now xyplotExt so that it does not look like an attempt to give a method for xyplot.

5.6

* viewtex calls as.pdf.tex to wrap the contents of a tex file appropriately and display it in the default pdf viewer.  By default, viewtex deletes intermediate files after 1 second (presumably enough time to get them open).  You can also pass onefile=TRUE, which is an argument to as.pdf.tex.

5.5

* data/ctl has moved.  

* metrumrgURL has been implemented for offline access to internal help files.

5.4

* metrumrg 5.4 has a new entry on the main help page.  The 'browse' link takes you to a list of annotated scripts that demonstrate various pharmacometric tasks using metrumrg tools.  Some involve NONMEM; for full reproducibility, check out the repository onto a machine with an NMQual-mediated NONMEM 7.2 installation.

5.3

* metrumrg 5.3 fixes a bug in resample.data.frame().  If the user supplied the extra argument 'na', it was partially-matched to the 'name' argument of a function defined internally, preventing intended use.

* The pattern argument for rlog has been augmented.

5.2

* as.pdf and related functions support creating pdf's directly from data frames.  The utility 'pdflatex' must already be present at the OS level, and visible on the command line.

5.1

* metrumrg 5.1 is essentially a clone of MIfuns 5.1. Package name has changed to more accurately reflect sponsorship.  See mifuns.googlecode.com for prior versions.
